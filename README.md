============

Javascript DatePicker

This datapicker implementation is intended to be stand-alone, that is no
external files are used.  As much as I really like jquery, jquery-ui and 
others, I got tired of running into conflicts of some sort.  So I created
a simple datapicker that relies on nothing else.
